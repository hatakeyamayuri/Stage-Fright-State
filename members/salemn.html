                <p class="BirthdayDay" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Birthday</b>: February 29</p>
                <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Degree(s)</b>: Bachelor in Music</p>
                <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Background</b>: Salemn fell in love with music when they were in elementary school. They took their first choir class and immediately leaned into the sweet melody of how a voice can make you want to dance. They started to learn how to play the guitar when their friend handed them her own guitar to see how it feels. Salemn self-taught themselves how to play the guitar since they were in middle school.</p>
                <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Connection Before</b>: They had a subtle academic rivalry with Haley during university that played a role in how the band…came to be.</p>
                <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Glimpse of the Past</b>: When Salemn met the group, they were a junior and completing their Bachelor in Music.</p>
                <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Favorite Moment</b>: “It would easily be the first moment on a big stage with a huge crowd. It was as nerve wracking as anyone could think and it was almost impossible to get the words out that I needed to introduce the show but as soon as they fell into the groove it was like nothing was around them. Just the music.”</p>
