        <p class="BirthdayDay" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Birthday</b>: January 1</p>
        <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Degree(s)</b>: Bachelor and Master in English Literature (recently completed in 2024)</p>
        <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Background</b>: Lucy was a music festival lover ever since she was a young girl and saw musicians play. She picked her first guitar up when she was eleven and took lessons to learn how to play the instrument. Lucy could play both acoustic and electric by the time she was fourteen. She also took music as a class during her high school, so she could learn more about the guitar. (She can play both left-handed and right-handed guitars too.)</p>
        <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Connection Before</b>: Lucy is a childhood friend of Lily and Kaitlyn. She only knew of Salemn and Haley by passing them at their university.</p>
        <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Glimpse of the Past</b>: When she first met the others, Lucy was a junior in college and earning her bachelor in English Literature.</p>
        <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Favorite Moment</b>: “After our first concert, we all got backstage and had a moment where we just stared at each other. you could still hear the crowd, a pretty small one but a whole lot bigger than we were used to. we stood in shock, like ‘holy crap we just did that’ and suddenly burst out laughing. We were just some college kids that practiced in Haley's garage, and we just played our own set in front of 300 people. It was surreal. I think while we were on stage we were so focused on the music that we didn’t really think about the crowd. but after, it hit us. This could really be something.”</p>
