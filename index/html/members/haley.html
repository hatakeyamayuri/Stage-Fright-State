            <p class="BirthdayDay" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Birthday</b>: January 4</p>
            <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Degree(s)</b>: Bachelor and Master in Music (recently completed in 2024)</p>
            <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Background</b>: Haley had followed the passage of music when she had become a freshman in high school. She had listened to a lot of rock bands for a couple years before high school and mostly liked the sounds of the drums out of everything else. So, Haley decided to finally take classes when she was a freshman to learn how to play the drums for fun.</p>
            <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Connection Before</b>: Haley had a subtle academic rivalry with Salemn during university that led to a few…surprising incidents.</p>
            <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Glimpse of the Past</b>: When Haley met the group, she was a junior and completing her Bachelor in Music.</p>
            <p class="MiniBout" style="font-family:Century Gothic;"><b>Favorite Moment</b>: “It had to be our first professional photoshoot that strikes me as memorable. To me, it hit like being smacked with a rubber chicken that we just completed such a major milestone for the band. We were growing and becoming successful as one and that made me so thrilled for what comes next for Stage Fright.”</p>
