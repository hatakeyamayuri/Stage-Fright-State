                        <b><i><u>Stage Fright</u></i></b> is an up-and-coming alternative rock band. <i>Lucy, Lily, Haley, Salemn, </i>and <i>Kaitlyn</i> were childhood friends (<i>and rivals at times</i>...) and are now bound by their unquenchable passion for new sound and music.
                        </p>
                        <p class="BoutTime" style="font-family:Century Gothic;">
                        The story of <i>Stage Fright</i> began in 2020. <i>Lucy, Lily, Haley, Salemn,</i> and <i>Kaitlyn</i> were preparing for the 
                        first Talent Show at the Festival of Music and Art. An empty, run-down building at the corner of Seventh and James was an easy
                        place to play music as they wanted, away from the daily distractions. However, they couldn't get away from the distractions of
                        others' msuic. As fate has it, when started as attempts to disrupt and overpower others' sounds, the five quickly got drawn to 
                        the sound of disequilibrium they were generating together. Lucy's xxx, Lily's xxx, Haley's free-wheeling drum, Salemn's metallic
                        dry voice and Kaitlyn's xxx.... mingle as rifts that create a sound that is 'unborn' as the group Metallica puts it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="BoutTime" style="font-family:Century Gothic;">
                        In December 2020, the group made their debut at their school's WInterfest. They named their group, <b><i><u>Stage Fright,</u></i></b> 
                        as an attempt to own their insecurities rather than being afraid. What they did not know was how this would transform the meaning of 
                        'stage fright'. Janice Yoder (<i>the Rollins Stone</i>) put it this way:"Stage Fright is presumably the nervousness one feels when on 
                        stage. However, the <b><i><u>Stage Fright,</u></i></b> once on the stage, shows how you can disown your fear...by owning it. Their 
                        sound mesmerizes our fears - all the insecure people of the word - and even their own stage fright despite their name."

                            <p style="font-family:Century Gothic;">In September, the group meets each other during a talent show hosted by their university. In November, the five officially 
                                banded together and did their first small concert for their university in December. They also earn their name <i>Stage Fright</i>
                                from a colleague.
